# DropDownList



## 

RadDropDownList is an enhanced alternative to the standard Windows Forms combo box control. RadDropDownList can be bound to data sources. 
        RadDropDownList allows you to replace its major components giving you control over its visual and data behavior. Users can now exercise control 
        over the scrolling logic, the items layout and even the low level data binding logic by providing their own data layer.![dropdown-and-listcontrol-dropdownlist-overview 001](images/dropdown-and-listcontrol-dropdownlist-overview001.png)
