# Adding the Control Spy to Your Application

## 

To add the Control Spy to your application, you must add a reference to the __RadControlSpy.dll__ library, which is installed by default at: *C:\Program Files\Telerik\UI for WinForms\Version\Examples\bin*

This library contains functionality used in the Telerik UI for WinForms Examples application that is also available to your applications.
