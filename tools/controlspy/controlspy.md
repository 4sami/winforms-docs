## 

The Control Spy is a tool to let you examine the detailed internal structure of any RadControl. It is not a stand-alone tool. Rather, the Control Spy is supplied as part of a library that you compile into your application. After adding this library, you can start the Control Spy and use it to examine and alter properties of any RadControl which is currently running.
