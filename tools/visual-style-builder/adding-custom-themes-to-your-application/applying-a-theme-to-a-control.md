# Applying a Theme to a Control

## 

To apply a custom theme from __[RadThemeManager]({%slug winforms/tools/visual-style-builder/adding-custom-themes-to-your-application/adding-radthememanager-to-a-form%})__ to a RadControl, first select the control on the form. From the drop-down list in the control __ThemeName__ property, select the theme. The list of themes supplied by __RadThemeManager__ will be merged with the list of predefined themes supplied for the control.
