# Menu Merge in MDI applications



## 

RadMenu automatically discovers that it is placed in a child MDI form. When a child MDI formÂ is maximized, RadMenu automatically merges the Menu items in the parent form using the MergeType and MergeOrder properties defined for each RadMenuItem. When a child form is restored/minimized, the parent menu state is restored.

Please refer to the next [section]({%slug winforms/menus/menu/menu-merge/menu-merge%}) about MergeType and MergeOrder properties.![menus-menu-menu-merge-menu-merge-in-mdi-applications 001](images/menus-menu-menu-merge-menu-merge-in-mdi-applications001.png)
