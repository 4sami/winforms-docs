# WaitingBar

## 

RadWaitingBar is designed to indicate that a long-running operation with indeterminate  length is undergoing. The control supports waiting animation in four directions: Left, Right, Bottom and Top, and also three different styles: __Indeterminate__,  __Throbber__ and __Dash__:        
		

* The __Indeterminate__ style is similar to the  indeterminate mode of the standard Microsoft ProgressBar control. In this style RadWaitingBar smoothly animates all indicators longwise. 

* The __Throbber__ mode moves only one of the controlâ€™s indicators in two directions, left and right when the RadWaitingBar is horizontal, and bottom and top when the control is vertical.

* In __Dash__ style RadWaitingBar moves smoothly a striped pattern instead of indicators.
