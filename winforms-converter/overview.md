# WinForms Converter

This tool allows you to convert all default .NET controls in a particular solution to their equivalent in Telerik UI for WinForms. It aims to speed up the conversion process, and save time when such old projects are modernized. Here are the main capabilities:

* __Large number of supported controls__ - complete list of the converted controls is available here: [Supported Controls]({%slug winforms/installation-deployment-and-distribution/visual-studio-extensions/supported-controls%}) You can chose which controls to be converted as well.

* __Real-Time differences resolving__ - after the project is converted you can view the differences in Visual Studio.

* __BackUp support__ - you can create a backup of the converted solution. 

* __Conversion Log__ - you can generate a conversion log which contains detailed information about the conversion process.  

* __Convert to a specific version__ you can choose to which version of Telerik UI for WinForms you want to convert.
