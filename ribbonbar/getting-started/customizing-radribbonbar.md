# Customizing RadRibbonBar



## 

You can control several aspects of the overall Telerik RadRibbonBar presentation by setting the corresponding properties:

* The __Expanded__ property controls whether the base of the control (the area beneath the tabs) will be visible initially. Set this property to __False__ to hide the base of the control.

>note The Expanded property also indicates whether the Ribbon Bar is expanded or collapsed. For instance, the end-user can collapse the control by double-clicking on any of the tabs
>

* The __ShowExpandButton__ property controls whether the expand/collapse button will shown in RadRibbonBar. Set this property to __True__ to show the button.

* The __ShowHelpButton__ property controls whether the Help button will shown in RadRibbonBar. Set this property to __True__ to show the button.

* The __StartButtonImage__ property specifies an image to use for the Start Button in the upper left corner of the control.

>note The size of the Start Button is determined by the size of the image set.
>

* The __Text__ property determines the text which is displayed in the Ribbon Bar's caption.
