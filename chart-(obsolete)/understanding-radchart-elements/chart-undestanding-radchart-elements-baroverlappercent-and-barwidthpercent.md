# BarOverLapPercent and BarWidthPercent



## 

In bar charts with multiple series __BarOverLapPercent__ governs to what degree the bars will overlap the preceding bar series. If you enter a negative value for __BarOverLapPercent____,__a gap appears between the bars of different series. Overlapping is especially useful when a long series of items needs to fit in a small-size chart. 

__BarWidthPercent______controls how much space each bar takes up so that a __BarWidthPercent__ of 100 will have all the bars in the chart taking exactly all the available width. 

>The maximum bar width is calculated as follows: *bar width* = *axis length* / *bars**count*. 

See the examples below to see how these two properties work together.![chart-undestanding-radchart-elements-baroverlappercent-and-barwidthpercent 001](images/chart-undestanding-radchart-elements-baroverlappercent-and-barwidthpercent001.png)![chart-undestanding-radchart-elements-baroverlappercent-and-barwidthpercent 002](images/chart-undestanding-radchart-elements-baroverlappercent-and-barwidthpercent002.png)![chart-undestanding-radchart-elements-baroverlappercent-and-barwidthpercent 003](images/chart-undestanding-radchart-elements-baroverlappercent-and-barwidthpercent003.png)![chart-undestanding-radchart-elements-baroverlappercent-and-barwidthpercent 004](images/chart-undestanding-radchart-elements-baroverlappercent-and-barwidthpercent004.png)
