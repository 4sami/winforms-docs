# CommandBar



RadCommandBar is a fully theme-able tool strip that provides unprecedented flexibility. More than just a collection of buttons, RadCommandBar hosts any RadControl, including combo boxes, text boxes, split buttons, drop-down buttons, toggle buttons and more. CommandBar can be moved, rearranged and resized at run time for easy end-user customization. RadCommandBar can be styled to match any user interface using a predefined theme or a theme you design yourself using the Visual Style Builder.

## Theming

The appearance of the RadCommandBar, containers and tool items can be
          tailored using one of the predefined themes, altering an existing theme in the
          Visual Style Builder, or by building your own custom themes with Visual Style Builder.
          Visual Style Builder lets you alter the look and feel of the toolstrip and of each
          individual item in the toolstrip, including dynamically changing properties using the
          new Visual Style Builder animation capabilities.

## Overflow Handling

The overflow button automatically displays items that don't have the real
          estate to display by default. The end user can also customize the toolstrip by
          adding and removing buttons.
