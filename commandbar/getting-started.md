# Getting Started

* To add a __RadCommandBar__ to your form, drag a __RadCommandBar__ from the toolbox onto the surface of the form designer. In order to set up the __RadCommandBar__ at design time you can refer to the [Design time]({%slug  winforms/commandbar/design-time%}) help article.

* To programmaticallyÂ add a __RadCommandBar__ to a form, create a new instance of a __RadCommandBar__, and add it to the form __Controls__ collection.
