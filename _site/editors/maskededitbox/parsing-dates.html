            <h1 id="parsing-dates"><a href="#parsing-dates">Parsing Dates</a></h1>

<p>When <strong>RadMaskedEditBox</strong> is with <strong>MaksType</strong> FreeFormDateTime the control tries to recognize a free-form string and convert it to a valid date.<br>
        In this article you can find information about the algorithms that are using and what they are able to parse.</p>

<p>The input string can contain a date and time part. Entries are always interpreted left to right and date matching is attempted before time parsing.</p>

<h2 id="date-building-blocks"><a href="#date-building-blocks">Date building blocks</a></h2>

<p>A date is composed of different words or blocks of text. The first stage of date parsing is to split the input string in various "atoms" that are used <br>
          to determine the actual date. <strong>RadMaskedEditBox</strong> recognizes the following.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Numbers:</strong> integer values that are interpreted as decimal numbers.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Month names:</strong> both normal and abbreviated month names are recognized. The names will be different for each culture.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Time separators:</strong> a culture specific setting (a colon (":") symbol for the American English culture).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>AM/PM designator:</strong> a culture-specific setting.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Week day names:</strong> both normal and abbreviated. These are also culture specific.</p></li>
</ul>

<pre><code>    Date grouping and structure
</code></pre>

<p>Date parts are grouped into known date entries that can be evaluated. The result contains a date and time part. The date part can be:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>A month/day/year triplet: a month can be either a numeric value or a month name. The order of the parts in the triplet is culture specific.</p></li>
<li><p>A month/day or day/year pair: again, months can be both specified with a number or a name.</p></li>
<li><p>If a DateFormat string without "d"(day part) is provided the value could be entered as month/year or year/month</p></li>
<li><p>A single entry of a day, week day, month, or year.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>The time part is simpler: it is always composed of one to three numbers and an optional AM/PM designator.</p>

<p>An important thing to note here is the way <strong>RadMaskedEditBox</strong> determines the end of the date part and the start of the time one. <br>
        The parser has two modes of operation: DateTime and TimeOnly. The mode is determined by the <strong>DateFormat</strong> property value: if the date format<br>
        does not contain any date-formatting instructions, then the control switches to TimeOnly mode. Both modes have different behavior with regard to time parsing:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>DateTime: An entry of "2 Jan 07 5 20" is interpreted as January 2, 2007 5:20 because the parser found a triplet that gives complete information about the date.<br>
          Once it has matched the date, it treats the rest of the input as a time entry. Not supplying a full triplet can cause some of the time values <br>
          to be interpreted as date numbers: e.g. "2 Jan 5 20" is interpreted as January 2, 2005 20:00 (8 PM). To give the control a hint that you are supplying a time<br>
          value, separate the time values with the time separator. The above entry can be changed to "2 Jan 5:20" and <strong>RadMaskedEditBox</strong> will correctly interpret it as <br>
          January 2 5:20.</p></li>
<li><p>TimeOnly: Having a TimeOnly mode means that we do not have to care about the date part and we can relax the time separator requirement. <br>
          In this mode "4 15 30 pm" will be interpreted as 4:15:30 PM or 16:15:30.</p></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="date-evaluation"><a href="#date-evaluation">Date evaluation</a></h2>

<p>The last step in date parsing is to take the entry and turn it into a real date. There are several rules that the control obeys.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Incomplete dates are always evaluated taking the current date as a basis. For example, "January 2" means January 2 this year. <br>
          If the current month is April, an entry of "10" is interpreted as April 10, this year.</p></li>
<li><p>Numbers greater than 31 are always be interpreted as year values if possible (if within the <strong>MinDate/MaxDate</strong> range).</p></li>
<li><p>Two digit years are interpreted as a year in the <strong>ShortDateCenturyStart-ShortDateCenturyEnd</strong> range. "89" means 1989, and 15 -- "2015".</p></li>
<li><p>Week days are interpreted as a "move to the next available day" operation. Thus an entry of "Monday"<br>
          moves to the next Monday and sets it as the selected date. Week day names are ignored if a fully specified date (a date triplet) is already entered.</p></li>
<li><p>Single month names are interpreted as changing the month for the current date. If the current date is April 10, an entry of "Oct" will evaluate to October 10.</p></li>
</ul>

<pre><code>    Dates without separators
</code></pre>

<p>Besides the regular date parsing rules and heuristics described above, <strong>RadMaskedEditBox</strong> can successfully parse 6-digit and 8-digit date formats that <br>
          have no separators e.g. MMddyy or MMddyyyy. Note, however, that the support provided for these formats relies heavily on the currently set culture for <br>
          the input control. For example <strong>RadMaskedEditBox</strong> with an en-US culture set will use the short date format to interpret an entry as month-day-year.<br>
          Here are a few sample entries for the <strong>en-US</strong> culture:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>"050707" - <strong>OK</strong>, parsed as May 7th, 2007 (the control is trying to parse 05-07-07)</p></li>
<li><p>"05072007" - <strong>OK</strong>, parsed as May 7th, 2007 (the control is trying to parse 05-07-2007 -- note that the digits are split like this based on the <br>
          culture-specific slot distribution month, date, year i.e. in a 8-digit format where year should be last the last 4 digits of the representation)</p></li>
<li><p>"070507" - <strong>OK</strong>, parsed as July 5th, 2007 (the control is trying to parse 07-05-07)</p></li>
<li><p>"20070507" - <strong>NOT OK</strong>. In the en-US culture, this parses to 20-07-0507, which is evaluated as July 20th, 507. As this value is usually outside the range <br>
          set by the <strong>MinDate</strong> property, this date would be out of the valid range. To interpret this string as it was probably meant <br>
          (with a 4-digit year in the first slot), the <strong>RadMaskedEditBox</strong> control would need a different <strong>Culture</strong> setting.</p></li>
<li><p>"012010" - <strong>OK</strong>. Parsed as January 20th 2010. However, if both numbers are less than 12, the format will be considered during the parsing.<br>
          For example if the current culture has format like "MM/YY", "5 9"" will be parsed as "5 2009". And if the current culture has format "YY/MM" the<br>
          same input will be parsed as "2009 5". If one of the numbers is greater than 12, it will be considered as year, and the other one as month. <br>
          If the both are greater than 12, the <strong>RadMaskedEditBox</strong> will fail to parse the input string.</p></li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>If the current culture was <strong>fr-CA</strong> (with short date format "yyyy-MM-dd" where the year slot is first) the input entry "20070507" would be evaluated properly<br>
            as May 7th, 2007.</p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>•   "moh-CA" culture has ‘’:" symbols in the MonthNames and DayNames which is used also as time separator symbol, which leads to incorrect parsing.</p></li>
<li><p>•   "gd-GB", "vi-VN", "so-SO" cultures have " "(white space) symbols in the MonthNames collection which is recognized as separator from parse<br>
            logic and month cannot be found correctly in some cases.</p></li>
<li><p>•   "ja-JP","ko-KR","mn-MN"," ug-CN"," zh-CN"- in these cultures the MonthNames  or AbbreviatedMonthNames represent combination from digits and chars for example:"1月". <br>
            The parse logic recognize this as two tokens which leads to incorrect result.</p></li>
<li><p>•   These cultures "as-IN","bn-BD","bn-IN","bo-CN","dv-MV","hi-IN","km-KH","kh-IN","kn-IN","kok-IN","lo-LA","ml-IN", "mr-IN", "my-MM","ne-IN","ne-NP","nqo-GN",<br>
            "or-IN","pa-IN","qut-GT","sa-IN","si-LK", "ta-IN","ta-LK","te-IN", "tzm-Tfng-MA" , "zgh-Tfng-MA" - have unsupported chars.</p></li>
<li><p>•   "br-FR" - has " ' " symbols in the MonthNames  which is not supported from parsing logic.</p></li>
<li><p>•   "fy-NL" - in this culture for MonthNames  for March and May are "maa***" and "maa***", AbbreviatedMonthNames for May is "maa", when the date is enter with "maa",the parse <br>
            logic searching first into long names and return March but the user want May and typed it in AbbreviatedMonthNames format which is not correct parsing.</p></li>
