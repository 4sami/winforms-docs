# Wizard



## 

The __RadWizard__ control will help you differentiate a complex process into separate steps
        	and provide your users with the ability to govern the process upon their decisions. It is useful for creating 
        	installation, registration and other types of wizards.
        

RadWizard supports both *Wizard 97* and *Wizard Aero* 
        	specifications. The control provides the developers with predesigned *Welcome*,
        	*Completion* and *Internal* pages. Follows an example
        	of a RadWizard Welcome page:

The [design time]({%slug wizard-design-time%}) 
        	capabilities of the RadWizard control are rich and intuitive to use. They allow the developers to create and manage the control and its pages.
        	Handful [events]({%slug wizard-events%}) 
        	help you to follow the state of the control at run time, implement custom pages sequence and page processing validation.
