# Panel



RadPanel provides the features of a standard panel but adds advanced styling and text:<br>![panels-and-labels-panel-overview 001](images/panels-and-labels-panel-overview001.png)

The screenshot above demonstrates the use of a border, border width, background with a linear gradient, and Html-like formatted text. 

>note Please refer to Html-like formatting for further details about it.
