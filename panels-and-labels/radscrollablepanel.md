# RadScrollablePanel



## 

RadScrollablePanel is a variation of
          [RadPanel]({%slug winforms/panels-and-labels/panel%}).
          , but customized to support themable scrollbars. The control is composed of two
          [RadScrollBars]({%slug winforms/track-and-status-controls/scrollbar%}).
          and a RadPanel that represents a container for other controls and provides the scrolling
          functionality. The control can be used exactly as a standard panel - any controls can be
          easily added to it with the standard Visual Studio drag-and-drop routine.
          It supports all Telerik Themes, but the appearance of the panel and the scrollbars
          can be further customized to fit your application skin theme.
