# CollapsiblePanel



__RadCollapsiblePanel__ is an expandable panel which can host controls in its content area. The content area can be collapsed, which allows you to save space in your WinForms application. __RadCollapsiblePanel__ also gives you control over its __ExpandDirection__ for even greater flexibility.![panels-and-labels-collapsible-panel 001](images/panels-and-labels-collapsible-panel001.gif)
