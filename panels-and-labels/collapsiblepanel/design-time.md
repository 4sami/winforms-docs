# Design Time



RadCollapsiblePanel can have all of its properties modified at Design time. One way is to use the smart tag which exposes the most basic properties: <br>![panels-and-labels-collapsible-panel-design-time 001](images/panels-and-labels-collapsible-panel-design-time001.png)

The other way is to use the __Properties Window__. You can also expand or collapse the panel which allows you to better judge what your layout will look like. <br>![panels-and-labels-collapsible-panel-design-time 002](images/panels-and-labels-collapsible-panel-design-time002.png)

>note Setting the __IsExpanded__ property in at design time expands or collapses the control without animations.
