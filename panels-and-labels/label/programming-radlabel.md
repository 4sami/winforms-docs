# Programming RadLabel



## 

RadLabel shares most of the properties of the standard Windows Form Label, including:

* The __BackColor__ property sets the background color of the control.

* The __BackgroundImage__ and __BackgroundImageLayout__ properties allow you to tile,
            center, stretch, or zoom an image across the control.

* The __ForeColor__ property sets the Text property of the control.

* The __Text__ property sets the text in the control.

The example below has the BackgroundImage property set to "BlueHills.jpg" (available in the \Samples Pictures directory of many Windows installations) and __BackgroundImageLayout__set to __Stretch__. The ForeColor property is set to White.![panels-and-labels-label-programming-radlabel 001](images/panels-and-labels-label-programming-radlabel001.png)
