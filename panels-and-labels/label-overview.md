# Label



## 

RadLabel is a themeable alternative to the standard Windows Forms label control. It allows you to include a label in your applications that is consistent in look and feel with the other
          Telerik UI for WinForms controls. The example below uses a custom theme that provides a slight shadow to the text, and a highlight when the mouse passes over the label.
