# Printing Support

The printing support of RadPivotGrid allows the end user to directly pass its data to the printer. RadPivotGrid uses the same printing mechanism as RadGridView and RadScheduler and therefore shares the common features provided by [RadPrintDocument]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/printing-support/radprintdocument%}). You can modify the appearance and the layout of the printed pages by using the variety of options provided by the __PivotGridPrintStyle__ class.

## 

The RadPivotGrid has two public methods available for printing â€“ __Print()__ and __PrintPreview()__ methods. The first method will directly send a print job to the default printer with the settings currently saved in the __PrintStyle__ property. This method has one overload available which can show a system __PrintDialog__ with the available printers and their options.

The other available method is __PrintPreview()__. It opens a new RadPrintPreviewDialog which is discussed in details [here]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/printing-support/end-user-functionality/print-preview-dialog%}).
