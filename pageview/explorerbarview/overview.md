# ExplorerBarView



## 

The ExplorerBar mode of the RadPageView control is designed to handle multiple visible pages at once by implementing a scrolling mechanism, as well as extended keyboard navigation. This mode introduces three types of content sizing - __FixedLenght__, __AutoSizeToBestFit__ and __EqualLenght__, as well as two types of stack position - __Top__ and __Left__.
