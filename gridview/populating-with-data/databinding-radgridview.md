## 

RadGridView binds to collections of [bindable types]({%slug winforms/gridview/populating-with-data/bindable-types%}) from many sources including:

* [Array and ArrayList]({%slug winforms/gridview/populating-with-data/binding-to-array-and-arraylist%}) of simple types or custom objects.

* [Generic Lists]({%slug winforms/gridview/populating-with-data/binding-to-generic-lists%}) of simple types or custom objects.

* [BindingList]({%slug winforms/gridview/populating-with-data/binding-to-bindinglist%}) or other IBindingList implementations.

* Database data using [DataTable, DataSet]({%slug winforms/gridview/populating-with-data/tutorial:-binding-to-datatable-or-dataset%}) or [DataReader]({%slug winforms/gridview/populating-with-data/binding-to-datareader%}) components from a wide range of providers (MS SQL, Oracle, Access, anything accessible through OleDb).

RadGridView can bind to a single level of data or multiple levels of [hierarchical data]({%slug winforms/gridview/hierarchical-grid/binding-to-hierarchical-data%}). 

RadGridView can work in so called [Unbound mode]({%slug winforms/gridview/populating-with-data/unbound-mode%}), where the grid is not bound to any data and using the grid API, you specify the data (columns and rows) that will be displayed  dynamically at runtime.
