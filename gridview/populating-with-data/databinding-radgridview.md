## 

RadGridView binds to collections of [bindable types]({%slug gridview-populating-with-data-bindable-types%}) from many sources including:

* [Array and ArrayList]({%slug gridview-populating-with-data-binding-to-array-and-arraylist%}) of simple types or custom objects.

* [Generic Lists]({%slug gridview-populating-with-data-binding-to-generic-list%}) of simple types or custom objects.

* [BindingList]({%slug gridview-populating-with-data-binding-to-bindinglist%}) or other IBindingList implementations.

* Database data using [DataTable,
            DataSet]({%slug gridview-populating-with-data-tutorial-binding-to-datatable-or-dataset%}) or [DataReader]({%slug gridview-populating-with-data-binding-to-datareader%})
            components from a wide range of providers (MS SQL, Oracle, Access, anything accessible through OleDb).

RadGridView can bind to a single level of data or multiple levels of [hierarchical data]({%slug gridview-hierarchical-grid-binding-to-hierarchical-data%}). 

RadGridView can work in so called [Unbound mode]({%slug gridview-populating-with-data-unbound-mode%}), where the grid is not bound to any data and using the grid API,  you specify the data (columns and rows) that will be displayed  dynamically at runtime.
