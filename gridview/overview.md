# GridView



## 

Thank you for choosing Telerik RadGridView for WinForms.

*RadGridView* is a grid component developed on top of
          [Telerik Presentation Framework]({%slug winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/overview%})
          which provides a combination of performance, extensibility, customizability, and ease of use. Its flexible hierarchy model allows for using
          different data providers and creating highly interactive interfaces for display and management of large data without performance lost.
