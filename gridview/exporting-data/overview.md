|[Export to Excel with RadGridView for WinForms](http://tv.telerik.com/radtips/radgrid/grid-to-excel)<br>In this RadTip, John Kellar demonstrates how you can export data stored in a RadGridView for Windows Forms to Excel using the ExcelML export options. (Runtime: 08:53)|

__RadGridView__ supports several built-in methods for exporting data:

* [Export to Excel via ExcelML]({%slug winforms/gridview/exporting-data/export-to-excel-via-excelml-format%})

* [Export to CSV]({%slug winforms/gridview/exporting-data/export-to-csv%})

* [Export to HTML]({%slug winforms/gridview/exporting-data/export-to-html%})

* [Export to PDF]({%slug winforms/gridview/exporting-data/export-to-pdf%})

You can also RadGridView data to a Telerik Reporting report for printing purposes.

>note As of Q1 2012 RadGridView natively supports printing. More information about this feature can be found [here]({%slug winforms/gridview/printing-support%}).
