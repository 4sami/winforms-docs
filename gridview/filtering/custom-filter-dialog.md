## Customizing composite filter dialog

When you select an item from the "Available Filter" menu, a __CompositeFilterForm__ is displayed. The __CreateCompositeFilterDialog__ event is fired before the __CompositeFilterForm__ is created. It allows you to create the default dialog and customize it or initialize your own implementation of the composite filter dialog.
