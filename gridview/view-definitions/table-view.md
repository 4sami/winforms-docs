# Table View



## 

This is the default view definition. The data is presented like a table and you can reorder, hide and pin columns. This is a typical table view:<br>![gridview-viewdefinitions-table-view 001](images/gridview-viewdefinitions-table-view001.png)

You need notÂ set this view manually and the view does not contain any properties to configure.
