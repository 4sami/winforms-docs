# Design-time



## 

At design time you can open RadExpressionEditor
          by clicking the ellipsis button of the columns'
          __Expression__ property:
        ![gridview-expressioneditor-design-time 001](images/gridview-expressioneditor-design-time001.png)

>At design time the "Result Preview" functionality is not working,
            because there is no real data to evaluate.
            In addition, the expression is checked for validity. However, it cannot be verified
            according to actual data and value types. Because of this, it is possible to save an invalid
            expression at design time. If an invalid expression is created,
            an exception message will be shown when the project is ran.
