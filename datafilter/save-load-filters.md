# Serialize/Deserialize Filters

You can use the __SaveXML__ and __LoadXml__ methods to save the current expression either in a file or in a stream. The following snippets are showing how you can save or load the current state.

#### SaveXML
{{source=..\SamplesCS\DataFilter\DataFilterGettingStarted.cs region=Save}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\DataFilter\DataFilterGettingStarted.vb region=Save}}
 


{{endregion}}


#### LoadXML

{{source=..\SamplesCS\DataFilter\DataFilterGettingStarted.cs region=Load}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\DataFilter\DataFilterGettingStarted.vb region=Load}}
 


{{endregion}}
