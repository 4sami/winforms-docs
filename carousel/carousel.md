RadCarousel is a navigation control that animates a series of elements either by the user clicking a particular element or by clicking the forward and back arrows. Based on top of the Telerik Presentation Framework (TPF), RadCarousel supports databinding, smooth animations and transitions, automatic generation of image reflections and dynamic addition and removal of items.Â ![carousel-overview 002](images/carousel-overview002 - Copy.png)
