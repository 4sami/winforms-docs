# Data Binding RadChart to an XML file



## 

To bind RadChart to XML data you can: 

1. [Bind directly to the XML file itself programmatically at run-time.]({%slug winforms/chart-(obsolete)/building-radcharts/binding-to-xml-directly-at-run-time%})

1. [Bind to XML data by using an XMLDataSource at design-time.]({%slug winforms/chart-(obsolete)/building-radcharts/binding-to-xml-at-design-time-using-an-xmldatasource%})

Products.XML is used for both examples.  The XML file is located in the same directory as the default page used to display it.
