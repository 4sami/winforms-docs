# ShapedForm



## 

The __ShapedForm__ control allows you to design and display a Windows 
        	form with any conceivable shape. You can couple this control with the 
        	[RadTitleBar control]({%slug winforms/forms-and-dialogs/radtitlebar%})
        	 to easily add forms with a completely custom look and feel to your applications.
