# Headers and Footers

The Headers and Footers functionality enables you to add rich text content in the page margins when laying out a worksheet to pages. This functionality is useful in scenarios like exporting to PDF, printing or importing/exporting to XLSX. 

## Overview

**RadSpreadsheet** enables you to add headers and footers in a spreadsheetâ€™s worksheet. The headers and footers appear when you print the worksheet or export it to a PDF document; they are not displayed on the worksheet when the document is visualized when you work with it in the application.
