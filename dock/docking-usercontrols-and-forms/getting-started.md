# Getting Started



## 

In order toÂ dock your UserControls and Forms in RadDock, you just need to use the DockControl method:

__DockControl(Control control, DockPosition position)__

This method will dock a Form, a UserControl, or simply any Control. A HostWindow with DockType ToolWindow will be created to host the Control.

For example, the following code snippet will result in the screenshot shown below:

#### __[C#] Docking a Form__

{{region dockingForm}}
	            Form form = new Form();
	            form.BackColor = Color.Pink;
	            form.Text = "My Form";
	            this.radDock1.DockControl(form, DockPosition.Left);
	            form.Show();
	{{endregion}}



#### __[VB.NET] Docking a Form__

{{region dockingForm}}
	        Dim form As Form = New Form()
	        form.BackColor = Color.Pink
	        form.Text = "My Form"
	        Me.RadDock1.DockControl(form, DockPosition.Left)
	        form.Show()
	{{endregion}}
