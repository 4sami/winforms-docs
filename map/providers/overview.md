# Providers Overview

The __RadMap__ control doesn't display a map on itself, it needs a map provider from which to consume the required data. Currently, __RadMap__ supports the following providers:

* [BingRestMapProvider]({%slug winforms/map/providers/bingrestmapprovider%})
* [OpenStreetMapProvider]({%slug winforms/map/providers/openstreetmapprovider%})
* [LocalMapProvider]({%slug winforms/map/providers/localmapprovider%})
* [EmptyMapProvider]({%slug winforms/map/providers/emptymapprovider%})
