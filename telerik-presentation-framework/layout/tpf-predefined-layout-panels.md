# Predefined Layout Panels



## 

Telerik UI for WinForms comes with a set of stock layout panels that handle most common layout
          tasks and also provide a basis for your own
          [custom layout panels]({%slug tpf-layout-custom-layout%}).
          The layout panel objects all descend from
          [ LayoutPanel]({%slug tpf-class-hierarchy-layoutpanel%})
          and are found in the Telerik.Wincontrols.Layouts namespace. Panels are responsible for determining both the size and position
          of the primitives that they contain. Panels can be nested to create arbitrarily complex layouts. The Telerik Presentation Framework includes the following panels:
        

* __[StackLayoutPanel]({%slug tpf-layout-predefined-layout-panels-stacklayoutpanel%})__

* __[WrapLayoutPanel]({%slug tpf-layout-predefined-layout-panels-wraplayoutpanel%})__

* __[GridLayout]({%slug tpf-layout-predefined-layout-panels-gridlayout%})__

* __[ImageAndTextLayoutPanel]({%slug tpf-layout-predefined-layout-panels-imageandtextlayoutpanel%})__

* __[BoxLayout]({%slug tpf-layout-predefined-layout-panels-boxlayout%})__

* __[DockLayout]({%slug tpf-layout-predefined-layout-panels-docklayout%})__
