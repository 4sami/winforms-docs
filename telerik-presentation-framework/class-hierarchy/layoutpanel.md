# LayoutPanel

## 

LayoutPanel represents a base class for all layout panels. Layout panels are RadElements, exist in the control tree and are responsible for the layout of primitives. Layout panels determine the size and position of primitives inside the panel. Because panels are RadElements, panels can be nested to provide an arbitrarily complex layout.
