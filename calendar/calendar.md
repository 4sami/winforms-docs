|[Using RadCalendar for WinForms](http://tv.telerik.com/winforms/radcalendar/using-radcalendar-for-winforms) In this video, you'll get an overview of using RadCalendar for WinForms; configuring important properties; using Special Days and Selected Days; styling; responding to Events with style changes. (Runtime: 10:23)|![](images/calendar-getting-started - Copy.png)|


Telerik Calendar supports all common features you would find in the standard Month Calendar control, such as first day of week, show today, special days, and show/hide week numbers, but adds several nifty features you will not find in the Visual Studio toolbox, such as focused date, show/hide week days, fish eye (date zoom functionality), read-only support, and show other month days. We went even further and extended the calendar functionality with footer support, controllable header/footer, fast navigation buttons, and full control over cell formatting (paddings, borders, margins, spacings, alignment, etc), making RadCalendar a feature-complete control with expected behavior, which your users will truly appreciate.
