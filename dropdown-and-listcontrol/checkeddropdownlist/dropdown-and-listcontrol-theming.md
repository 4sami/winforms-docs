          It consists of 4 different controls:

1. __RadAutoCompleteBox__ - Provides theming for the text area and the tokens
            

1. __RadDropDownList__ - Provides theming for the arrow button and the size of the control

You can see where to find each control in Visual Style Builder on the image below. We recommend to you to get to know [Visual Style Builder]({%slug tools-visual-style-builder-overview%})
