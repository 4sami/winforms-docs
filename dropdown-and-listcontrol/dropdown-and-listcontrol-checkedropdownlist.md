# CheckedDropDownList



## 

RadCheckedDropDownList combines [RadDropDownList]({%slug dropdown-and-listcontrol-dropdownlist-overview%}) and [RadAutoCompleteBox]({%slug editors-autocompletebox-overview%})
        in order to provide functionality to check items in the drop down area and tokenize them in the text area. All previous functionality is preserved, such as visual formatting and data binding, which is now
        extended.
