# Design Time



## 

To start using __RadPopupEditor__ just drag and drop it on the form. The smart tag allows you to set the associated __RadPopupContainer__ or the theme.

The control allows building the drop down layout at design time. For the purpose you should add [RadPopupContainer]({%slug winforms/editors/popupeditor/popupcontainer%}) as well. Once all controls are added to the container you should just associate it with the __RadPopupEditor__ and the controls will appear in the popup.
