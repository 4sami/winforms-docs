* Drag RadTimePicker control from the toolbox to the form.

* Modify the desired minute’s interval by setting the __Step__ property.

* Set the __ClockPosition__ property to *ClockAboveTables* to display the clock on the top of the popup.

* Set the __CloseButtonText__ to some string – *“Close window”*
