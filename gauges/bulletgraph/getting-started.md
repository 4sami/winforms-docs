# Getting Started



## 

When you drag a __RadBulletGraph__ from the Toolbox and drop it onto the form, the gauge gallery
          will offer you to pick up the desired type:
        ![bulletgraph-getting-started 001](images/bulletgraph-getting-started001.png)

>If you do not choose a gauge's style and just close the gallery, an empty __RadBulletGraph__ will be created.

You can change the gauge's style via the Smart tag's option Open Gallery as well.

>importantPlease note that when you select the style all events will be automatically created and you can directly access them. 
          You can create the control in code as well. More information is available in the following article:
