# BulletGraph



The __RadBulletGraph__ control is a variation of linear gauge. It combines a number of indicators, as well as the data indicator into one control, which is light weight, easily customizable and straightforward to setup and use. The control is a great tool for dashboards as it is the optimal way to present a lot of information in relatively small size.
