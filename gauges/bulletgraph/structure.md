The following screenshot demonstrates the elements available in the Bullet graph control:  ![bulletgraph-structure 001](images/bulletgraph-structure001.png)

There are two main types of bullet graphs - __horizontal__ and __vertical__, depending on the direction in
          which the control is drawn.
