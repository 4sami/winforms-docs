The __RadRadialGauge__ control is designed to display a simple value within a definite range. 
     This range is represented in a circular format similar to car speed dial. The circular container contains a scale in 
     it which controls the overall layout of ticks, tick labels, needles and ranges and renders an optional scale bar.![radialgauge-overview 001](images/radialgauge-overview001.gif)
