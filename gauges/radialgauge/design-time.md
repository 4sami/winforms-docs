# Design time



When you drag a __RadRadialGauge__ from the Toolbox and drop it onto the form, the gauge gallery will offer you to pick up the desired type:

## Smart tag

You can change the gauge's style via the Smart tag's option * Open Gallery*.

The Smart tag of __RadRadialGauge__ lets you quickly access and modify the __Items__ collection via the Smart tag's option
        *Edit Gauge Items*. Thus, you can add new gauge elements, modify or remove the existing ones:![radialgauge-design-time 003](images/radialgauge-design-time003.png)

Additionally, you can perform some modifications to the gauge elements and save the constructed layout via the *Save Gauge Layout to XML* option.
        Afterwards, you can add an empty gauge and load the stored layout via the *Load Gauge Layout from XML*.

The __RadRadialGauge__ control supports precise design time selection of the gauge elements in order to customize the selected element.![radialgauge-design-time 005](images/radialgauge-design-time005.png)
