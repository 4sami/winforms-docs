# Working with ticks



__RadialGaugeTicks__ are displayed next to the arc spanning the entire sweep angle.

## 

The following properties allow you to modify the ticks' look:

* __TicksCount__ - specifies how many ticks will be displayed. On the following picture
              the black ticks are 24, but the red ticks are 72.

* __TickStartIndexVisibleRange__ - specifies at which index the visible ticks range will start. On the following picture
              the red ticks start from index 45:

* __TickEndIndexVisibleRange__ - specifies at which index the visible ticks range will end. On the following picture
              the red ticks ends with index 50:

* __TicksRadiusPercentage__ - controls how far according to the gauge's arc the ticks will be rendered. On the following picture, 
              the red ticks have __TicksRadiusPercentage__ 80.

* __CircleTicks__ - controls whether the specific ticks are circle or not.

* __TickThickness__ - specifies how thick the ticks will be rendered.

* __TickColor__ - specifies the back color for the ticks

* __TicksOffset__ - specifies the ticks back length towards the center point.

* __TicksLenghtPercentage__ - controls the ticks length. On the picture below, the black ticks are with
              __TicksLenghtPercentage__ 10, but the red ones with 5.
