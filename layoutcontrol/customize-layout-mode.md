# Customize Layout Mode



This article describes how the layout can be changed at runtime.
      

## Customize Dialog

With __RadLayoutControl__ the predefined form layout can be edited at runtime.
          This can be achieved by opening the __Customize__ dialog. It can be opened from the default context menu.

Once the dialog is opened you will be able to rearrange the controls with drag and drop operations. 
          Additional items can be added from the __Items__ tab as well.

The current layout structure is shown in the
          __Structure__ tab. It allows you to easily select and even rearrange the controls by dragging from this tab to the form.

The customize dialog allows you to save/load the layout. This can be achieved by using the corresponding buttons.
        

## The DragOverlay

The __DragOverlay__ is a separate control which is shown when the customize dialog is opened. 
          It contains snapshot of the formâ€™s layout and is used for items arranging. 
          There is a __DragOvelay__ property which is allowing you to access this control.
          It allows you to access the drag and drop service as well.
