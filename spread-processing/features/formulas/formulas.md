# Formulas



A formula is an algebraic expression that contains values, operators, functions, and references to cells. The following list takes a closer look to the compound parts of formulas:
      

* __Values__: Expressions can contain numbers, booleans, strings, arrays. For example, all of the following formulas represent valid expressions that contain values of different type: =3+4, ="Rad"&"Spreadsheet", =AND(TRUE, FALSE), =SUM({1, 2; 3, 4}).
          

* __Operators__: Formulas can include arithmetic, comparison, cell reference, and text operators. Examples of expressions that use operators are:          =-1+2, =B1<=4, =SUM(A1:B4), ="Rad"&"Spreadsheet". More information about the supported operators can be found in the [Operator]({%slug winforms/spread-processing/features/formulas/operator%}) article.
          

* __Cell references__: Formulas can contain references to cells or ranges of cells. For example, the expression *=B1+B2* adds the values of cells B1 and B2 of the current worksheet, while the formula *=SUM(B1:B5)* sums up the values of all cells between B1 and B5. Further information about cell references is available in the [Cell References]({%slug winforms/spread-processing/features/formulas/cell-references%}) article.
          

* __Built-in functions__: You can take advantage of a large set of predefined functions that can be directly included in expressions. Examples of formulas that use built-in functions are: *=ABS(-5), =COS(PI()), =AND(B1, B2)<>OR(C1, C2)*. You can find the full list in the [Functions]({%slug winforms/spread-processing/features/formulas/functions%}) article.
          

## Get and set formulas in cells

In order to set the value of a cell to a formula use the __SetValue()__ method of the [CellSelection]({%slug winforms/spread-processing/working-with-cells/accessing-cells-of-a-worksheet%}) class and pass the formula string as an argument. In order to produce a formula value the string you enter should start with either __=__ (equal) or __â€“__ (minus) sign, otherwise, the method treats the input as plain text.
        

__Example 1__ creates a workbook from scratch and adds a worksheet. Further, the code assigns the value =3+4 to cell A1.

#### Example 1: Set formula

{{source=..\SamplesCS\RadSpreadProcessing\Features\Formulas\RadSpreadProcessingFormulas.cs region=radspreadprocessing-features-formulas_0}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\RadSpreadProcessing\Features\Formulas\RadSpreadProcessingFormulas.vb region=radspreadprocessing-features-formulas_0}} 

````C#
Workbook workbook = new Workbook();
workbook.Worksheets.Add();
workbook.ActiveWorksheet.Cells[0, 0].SetValue("=3+4");

````
````VB.NET
Dim workbook As New Workbook()
workbook.Worksheets.Add()
workbook.ActiveWorksheet.Cells(0, 0).SetValue("=3+4")

````

Additionally to entering formulas in cells, you can retrieve and inspect formula values. If you get the value of Cell[0, 0], the result will be an object of type __FormulaCellValue__. Just like other cell values, the __FormulaCellValue__ class inherits from __CellValueBase__ class and conforms to the __ICellValue__ interface. Thus, the class exposes several important properties and useful methods that allow you to get information about both the entered value and its result value.
        

A closer look at the value of cell A1 will reveal that the two methods __GetValueAsString()__ and __GetResultValueAsString()__ return the original string of the expression and string of the computed result, respectively. Similarly, the __FormulaCellValue__ offers information about the __CellValueType__ of its value and result value through the __ValueType__ and __ResultValueType__ properties.
       
#### Example 2: Get formula value

{{source=..\SamplesCS\RadSpreadProcessing\Features\Formulas\RadSpreadProcessingFormulas.cs region=radspreadprocessing-features-formulas_1}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\RadSpreadProcessing\Features\Formulas\RadSpreadProcessingFormulas.vb region=radspreadprocessing-features-formulas_1}} 

````C#
FormulaCellValue formulaCellValue = workbook.ActiveWorksheet.Cells[0, 0].GetValue().Value as FormulaCellValue;
if (formulaCellValue != null)
{
    RadExpression expression = formulaCellValue.Value;
    //expression is AdditionExpression with operands 3 and 4
    CellValueFormat format = workbook.ActiveWorksheet.Cells[0, 0].GetFormat().Value;
    string valueAsString = formulaCellValue.GetValueAsString(format);
    //valueAsString = "=3+4"
    string resultValueAsString = formulaCellValue.GetResultValueAsString(format);
    //resultAsString = "7"
    CellValueType valueType = formulaCellValue.ValueType;
    //valueType = Formula
    CellValueType resultValueType = formulaCellValue.ResultValueType;
    //resultValueType = Number
}

````
````VB.NET
Dim formulaCellValue As FormulaCellValue = TryCast(workbook.ActiveWorksheet.Cells(0, 0).GetValue().Value, FormulaCellValue)
If formulaCellValue IsNot Nothing Then
    Dim expression As RadExpression = formulaCellValue.Value
    'expression is AdditionExpression with operands 3 and 4
    Dim format As CellValueFormat = workbook.ActiveWorksheet.Cells(0, 0).GetFormat().Value
    Dim valueAsString As String = formulaCellValue.GetValueAsString(format)
    'valueAsString = "=3+4"
    Dim resultValueAsString As String = formulaCellValue.GetResultValueAsString(format)
    'resultAsString = "7"
    Dim valueType As CellValueType = formulaCellValue.ValueType
    'valueType = Formula
    'resultValueType = Number
    Dim resultValueType As CellValueType = formulaCellValue.ResultValueType
End If
