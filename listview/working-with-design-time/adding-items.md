# Adding items



## 

Adding items to RadListView at design time is possible through the __Items__ 
        	collection of the control. This collection is accessible by using the __Smart Tag__ or
        	the __Items__ collection property in the property grid.

Both of these will open __ListViewDataItemCollectionEditor__, from where, by clicking the
        	__Add__ button you can add items to the collection. Additionally, on the right hand side,.
          you will see a property grid, where you can change the properties of each item individually.
