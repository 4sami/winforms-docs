# Views



RadListView supports three __ViewTypes__ – *ListView*,
        	*IconsView* and *DetailsView*. 
        	Those are the basic views that every Windows user is familiar with since Windows Explorer offers them all.
        	With RadListView you can extend the view types functionality and customize its appearance in order
        	to fit your needs.
     

## ListView

The __ListView__ view has much the same look as RadListControl. It uses the engine 
        	of RadListView and takes benefits like checkboxes, editors and images from it. The 
        	__ListView__ view consists of vertically stacked list items:

## IconsView

The __IconView__ displays the list items in icons, a manner that you surely are familiar with from the
        	Windows Explorer. Its __Orientation__ property determines how the icons will
        	be displayed:

## DetailView

The __DetailView__ provides a grid-like interface for displaying items with
        	more than one data fields. Interesting features in this view are the options to resize columns
        	(__AllowColumnResize__), to reorder columns 
        	(__AllowColumnReorder__), set the columns sizes and to determine which
        	columns will be visible and which aren’t.
