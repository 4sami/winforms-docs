# GanttView 



## 

RadGanttView is a data-visualization and editing control for project planning data and different types of task and time scheduling. All tasks are represented as vertical bars aligned along a timeline with the beginning and end time of each task determining its location along the timeline. These elements and the dependencies between them comprise the work breakdown structure of a project.
