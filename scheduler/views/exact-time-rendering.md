# Exact time rendering



## 

__RadScheduler__ supports functionality to arrange appointments according to their start time and duration.
          The __EnableExactTimeRendering__ property should get or set a value, indicating whether the appointment
          start and end time should be rendered exactly. By default its value is *false*.
