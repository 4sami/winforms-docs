# Exact time rendering



## 

__RadScheduler__ supports functionality to arrange appointments according to their start time and duration. The __EnableExactTimeRendering__ property should get or set a value, indicating whether the appointment start and end time should be rendered exactly. By default its value is *false*.

>note Due to the great difference in the amount of time, which different time scales represent, appointments might become too small to render accurately in larger time scales.
