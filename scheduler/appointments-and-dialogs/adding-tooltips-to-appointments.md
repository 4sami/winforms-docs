# Adding Tooltips to Appointments

## 

You can create and associate a tooltip to an appointment in __RadScheduler__ by setting the __ToolTipText__ property to a string. The following example creates a new ToolTip with aÂ custom text. This example uses the __ToolTipText__ property of the Appointment class:

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\WorkingWithAppointments.cs region=toolTips}} 
{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\WorkingWithAppointments.vb region=toolTips}} 

````C#
Appointment myAppointment = new Appointment(DateTime.Now, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30), "Summary", "Description");
myAppointment.ToolTipText = "Custom Tooltip";
this.radScheduler1.Appointments.Add(myAppointment);

````
````VB.NET
Dim myAppointment As New Appointment(Date.Now, TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30), "Summary", "Description")
myAppointment.ToolTipText = "Custom Tooltip"
Me.RadScheduler1.Appointments.Add(myAppointment)

````
