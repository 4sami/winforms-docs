Adding Custom Fields to RadScheduler Appointments

When using RadScheduler for WinForms, it will almost always need to be customized in some way.
                This could come in the form of custom dialogs, context menus, or even custom appointments.
                In this blog entry, I am going to explain the steps required to add a custom field to RadScheduler.

The following tutorial will demonstrate how you can customize the default EditAppointmentDialog (shown above)
          by adding a custom field to it. In our case, we are going to add an E-mail field. This field will not
          only exist in the dialog as a control, but will also be stored as a value in the custom appointment provided below.
        

Here is a step by step guide how to achieve that:

1. First we have to create a new form (let's call it CustomAppointmentEditForm) which derives from EditAppointmentDialog in order to extend the default schedulerâ€™s dialog.
            

>In VB.NET you need to open the designer file and add the inherits statement there 

#### __[VB.NET] Inherit the form in VB.NET__

{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\CustomAppointmentEditForm.Designer.vb region=inheritsInVB}}
	<Global.Microsoft.VisualBasic.CompilerServices.DesignerGenerated()> _
	Partial Class CustomAppointmentEditForm
	    Inherits Telerik.WinControls.UI.Scheduler.Dialogs.EditAppointmentDialog
	{{endregion}}



1. Open the dialog in Design Time and add a label and a text box to under the Resource label and text box. Name the text box __txtEmail__

1. Here is the form's implementation:
            

#### __[C#] Extending the EditAppointmentDialog__

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\CustomAppointmentEditForm.cs region=customAppEditForm}}
	    public partial class CustomAppointmentEditForm : EditAppointmentDialog
	    {
	        public CustomAppointmentEditForm()
	        {
	            InitializeComponent();
	        }
	
	        protected override void LoadSettingsFromEvent(IEvent ev)
	        {
	            base.LoadSettingsFromEvent(ev);
	
	            AppointmentWithEmail appointmentWithEmail = ev as AppointmentWithEmail;
	            if (appointmentWithEmail != null)
	            {
	                this.txtEmail.Text = appointmentWithEmail.Email;
	            }
	        }
	
	        protected override void ApplySettingsToEvent(IEvent ev)
	        {
	            AppointmentWithEmail appointmentWithEmail = ev as AppointmentWithEmail;
	            if (appointmentWithEmail != null)
	            {
	                appointmentWithEmail.Email = this.txtEmail.Text;
	            }
	            base.ApplySettingsToEvent(ev);
	        }
	
	        protected override IEvent CreateNewEvent()
	        {
	            return new AppointmentWithEmail();
	        }
	    }
	{{endregion}}



#### __[VB.NET] Extending the EditAppointmentDialog__

{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\CustomAppointmentEditForm.vb region=customAppEditForm}}
	Public Class CustomAppointmentEditForm
	    Public Sub New()
	        InitializeComponent()
	    End Sub
	
	    Protected Overrides Sub LoadSettingsFromEvent(ByVal ev As IEvent)
	        MyBase.LoadSettingsFromEvent(ev)
	
	        Dim appointmentWithEmail As AppointmentWithEmail = TryCast(ev, AppointmentWithEmail)
	        If appointmentWithEmail IsNot Nothing Then
	            Me.txtEmail.Text = appointmentWithEmail.Email
	        End If
	    End Sub
	
	    Protected Overrides Sub ApplySettingsToEvent(ByVal ev As IEvent)
	        Dim appointmentWithEmail As AppointmentWithEmail = TryCast(ev, AppointmentWithEmail)
	        If appointmentWithEmail IsNot Nothing Then
	            appointmentWithEmail.Email = Me.txtEmail.Text
	        End If
	        MyBase.ApplySettingsToEvent(ev)
	    End Sub
	
	    Protected Overrides Function CreateNewEvent() As IEvent
	        Return New AppointmentWithEmail()
	    End Function
	End Class
	{{endregion}}



1. Create a new appointment class (let's call it AppointmentWithEmail) which derives from the Appointment class and add an Email property as shown:

#### __[C#] Extending the Appointment class__

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\AddingCustomFieldHelper.cs region=appWithMail}}
	    public class AppointmentWithEmail : Appointment
	    {
	        public AppointmentWithEmail()
	            : base()
	        {
	        }
	        private string email = string.Empty;
	        public string Email
	        {
	            get
	            {
	                return this.email;
	            }
	            set
	            {
	                if (this.email != value)
	                {
	                    this.email = value;
	                    this.OnPropertyChanged("Email");
	                }
	            }
	        }
	    }
	{{endregion}}



#### __[VB.NET] Extending the Appointment class__

{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\AddingCustomFieldHelper.vb region=appWithMail}}
	Public Class AppointmentWithEmail
	    Inherits Appointment
	    Public Sub New()
	        MyBase.New()
	    End Sub
	
	    Private _email As String = String.Empty
	    Public Property Email() As String
	        Get
	            Return Me._email
	        End Get
	        Set(ByVal value As String)
	            If Me._email <> value Then
	                Me._email = value
	                Me.OnPropertyChanged("Email")
	            End If
	        End Set
	    End Property
	End Class
	{{endregion}}



1. Create an appointment factory which returns our AppointmentWithEmail when creating appointments:

#### __[C#]__

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\AddingCustomFieldHelper.cs region=customAppFactory}}
	    public class CustomAppointmentFactory : IAppointmentFactory
	    {
	        #region IAppointmentFactory Members
	        public IEvent CreateNewAppointment()
	        {
	            return new AppointmentWithEmail();
	        }
	{{endregion}}



#### __[VB.NET]__

{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\AddingCustomFieldHelper.vb region=customAppFactory}}
	Public Class CustomAppointmentFactory
	    Implements IAppointmentFactory
	#Region "IAppointmentFactory Members"
	    Public Function CreateNewAppointment() As IEvent Implements IAppointmentFactory.CreateNewAppointment
	        Return New AppointmentWithEmail()
	    End Function
	{{endregion}}



1. Subscribe to the AppointmentEditDialogShowing event and in the event handler use the AppointmentEditDialog property of the event arguments to change the default 
              dialog with the custom one you just created. For optimization, you can create a global variable, which can be reused, instead of creating a new instance of the form every time.
            

#### __[C#] Associating new EditAppointment dialog__

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\AddingCustomField.cs region=showing}}
	        CustomAppointmentEditForm appointmentDialog = null;
	
	        void radScheduler1_AppointmentEditDialogShowing(object sender, AppointmentEditDialogShowingEventArgs e)
	        {
	            if (this.appointmentDialog == null)
	            {
	                this.appointmentDialog = new CustomAppointmentEditForm();
	            }
	           e.AppointmentEditDialog = this.appointmentDialog;
	        }
	{{endregion}}



#### __[VB.NET] Associating new EditAppointment dialog__

{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\AddingCustomField.vb region=showing}}
	    Private appointmentDialog As CustomAppointmentEditForm = Nothing
	
	    Private Sub radScheduler1_AppointmentEditDialogShowing(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As AppointmentEditDialogShowingEventArgs)
	        If Me.appointmentDialog Is Nothing Then
	            Me.appointmentDialog = New CustomAppointmentEditForm()
	        End If
	        e.AppointmentEditDialog = Me.appointmentDialog
	    End Sub
	{{endregion}}



1. Last, but not least we should assign the custom AppointmentFactory to our RadScheduler. This will
              come in handy when you create your appointments in-line:
            

#### __[C#] Extending the EditAppointmentDialog__

{{source=..\SamplesCS\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\AddingCustomField.cs region=settingFactory}}
	            this.radScheduler1.AppointmentFactory = new CustomAppointmentFactory();
	{{endregion}}



#### __[VB.NET] Extending the EditAppointmentDialog__

{{source=..\SamplesVB\Scheduler\AppointmentsAndDialogues\AddingCustomField.vb region=settingFactory}}
	        Me.RadScheduler1.AppointmentFactory = New CustomAppointmentFactory()
	{{endregion}}
